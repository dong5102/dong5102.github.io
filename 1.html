    <p>
        Chief executive of Roblox David Baszucki may well be letting out the "Oof"<br>
        sound made famous by the game, after the firm's debut on Wall Street<br>
        netted him $4.6bn (Â£3.3bn).
    </p>
    <p>
        The gaming platform has risen in value by 60% to $47bn after its first day of<br>
        trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
        It means it is worth more than some of biggest games publishers, including<br>
        Take Two, Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mr Baszucki said it would help create a digital world that went beyond gaming.
    </p>
    <p>
        "To all those who helped us get one step closer to fulfilling our vision of the<br>
        Metaverse - thank you,"
