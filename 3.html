            Chief executive of Roblox David Baszucki may well be letting out the "Oof"<br>
            sound made famous by the game, after the firm's debut on Wall Street<br>
            netted him $4.6bn (£3.3bn).
        </p>
        <p>
            The gaming platform has risen in value by 60% to $47bn after its first day of<br>
            trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
            It means it is worth more than some of biggest games publishers, including<br>
            Take Two, Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mr Baszucki said it would help create a digital world that went beyond gaming.
        </p>
        <p>
            "To all those who helped us get one step closer to fulfilling our vision of the<br>
            Metaverse - thank you,"
